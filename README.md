# Preprocessed css(less)

You are to demonstrate that you know how to use basic HTML and CSS by building a responsive single page marketing webpage for one of these three companies:

_Road Warriors_ - Bike shop

# Cozy Corner_ - Book store (Chose for this assignment) 
# Click Here [Link to My Project](https://bills2780spa.netlify.com/)



_Calm Mind_ - Spa 


You will use one of these companies as a guide for your content.  For design, you will need to find a website that you admire as a guide for layout.  You will then combine the company content and the layout of the website you admire to create a single page marketing site.

## Project Requirements

These project requirements directly impact the grading rubric, so read them carefully:

- [x] Pick one of the three companies in the project description as your client

- [x] Pick which website you admire to mimic for layout, you will provide the URL at the bottom of the readme file

- [x] You must have images and headings matching your clients content theme.  Everything else can be filler text (lorem ipsum)

- [x] Create a home page laid out and themed based on your choices from the above steps

- [x] Create a secondary page of your choice 

- [x] Your project must be submitted via git

- [x] Create a navigation that links between the home and secondary pages.
  
- [x] Create buttons on each page with a call to action for the user.  For example: Sign Up, Buy Now, etc.
  

## Preprossing Requirements
- [x] Utilize imports so that only one file is compiled from at least 4 imported files

- [x] Utilize variables for a font stack and colors
  
- [x] Nest your selectors so that they match the HTML structure

- [x] Create and use 2 unique mixins of your choice

- [x] Create a mixin that creates a custom button using parameters.  Apply these styles on the buttons you created in HTML for the home and services page

- [x] Create a mobile version of the home and secondary pages using escaped variables.  You can simply stack your content on top of itself, nothing complex is expected


## Project Resources

Images and content can be frustrating to find and use in any project.  To alleviate your time on design, consider using these resources so you can focus on the code:

- For copyright free images, you can use [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)

- For filler text use a [lorem ipsum generator](https://www.lipsum.com/)
